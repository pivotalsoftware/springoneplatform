							      	<p class='white'>The reactive programming model involves a fundamental shift from imperative to non-blocking logic and understanding what that means on the most basic level is an essential and required first step. In this talk we'll start by introducing reactive programming and discuss how it impacts application design. Then we'll take a look at the building blocks from a Java developer's perspective. Finally we'll complete the picture by checking out the upcoming Spring 5 support for reactive web applications.</p>

							      	<p class='white'>Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. It is used by over 90% of cloud deployments at Netflix. The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is heavily leveraged to fully articulate and extend Spinnaker’s automated deployment pipelines. SpEL is used heavily to interact with pipeline stages and triggers for variable substitution, information retrieval and conditional evaluation.  This session will walk through the evolution of Spinnaker’s use of SpEL over two years of active development. We will share the code, features and wisdom gained from helping theNetflix and open source community adopt SpEL. You should attend if you are interested in the Spinnaker platform and the continuous delivery pipelines feature, or wish to learn how to fully harness SpEL for your own tools.</p>

							      	<p class='white'>An edge gateway is an essential piece of infrastructure for large scale cloud based services. This presentation details the purpose, benefits and use cases for an edge gateway to provide security, traffic management and cloud cross region resiliency. How a gateway can be used to enhance continuous deployment, and help testing of new service versions and get service insights and more are discussed. Philosophical and architectural approaches to what belongs in a gateway vs what should be in services will be discussed. Real examples of how gateway services, built on top of Netflix's Open source project, Zuul, are used in front of nearly all of Netflix's consumer facing traffic will show how gateway infrastructure is used in real highly available, massive scale services.</p>

							      	<p class='white'>While Domain Driven Design is supposed to take care of complexity in the very core of software, REST is usually treated a plain remoting technology. In the talk we're going to explore some commonalities of the two when it comes to the design of both the domain and resources. We're going to discover how a good domain design is essential to build a great REST API in the first place and which means REST provides to make your APIs more domain driven. From all of the building blocks of DDD, the talk identifies the ones most important when it comes to building a good REST API: we're going to look at aggregates as natural boundaries for representations, repositories as the backing foundation for collection resources and how hypermedia allows to make domain specific state transitions explicit.</p>

							      	<h3 class='white'>Cloud Native Java</h3>
							      	<p class='white'>"It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming
											Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage.
											Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards.
											But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>

							      	<h3 class='white'>gRPC 101 for Spring Developers</h3>
							      	<p class='white'>gRPC is a high performance, open source, general RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. gRPC is based on many years of Google's experience in building distributed systems - it is designed to be low latency, bandwidth and CPU efficient, to create massively distributed systems that span data centers, as well as power mobile apps, real-time communications, IoT devices and APIs. It's also interoperable between multiple languages.</p>
											<p class='white'>
											But beyond that fact that it's more efficient than REST, we'll look into how to use gRPC's streaming API, where you can establish server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bidirectional streaming! This allows developers to build sophisticated real-time applications with ease.</p>
											<p class='white'>
											In addition to learning about gRPC and HTTP/2 concepts with code and demonstrations, we'll also deep dive into integration with existing build systems such as Maven and Gradle, but also frameworks such as Spring Boot and RxJava.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Writing/using a Spring Boot starter to run gRPC server</li>
												<li>Configuring projects to generate gRPC stub code</li>
												<li>Integrating w/ RxJava's observable sequences, which matches very well with gRPC's Stream Observable constructs</li>

							      	<h3 class='white'>The Five Stages of Cloud Native</h3>
							      	<p class='white'>The value of embracing microservices, containers, and continuous delivery is powerful only when brought together in logical, scalable, and portable ways. When used incorrectly it’s increasingly easy to make things much worse for you and your team, and do it at scale. For example, while microservices can be used to effectively isolate functionality, increase the speed of delivery, and help scale your team it can also be a way to inefficiently duplicate functionality and create single points of failure.  I’ll share anti-patterns and corresponding best practices based on my experience building application infrastructure and platforms, as well as the applications which are deployed to them.</p>

							      	<p class='white'>Ratpack and Spring Boot are a match made in microservice heaven. Each brings its respective strengths to the task of building a compelling service for the cloud. Spring Boot's incorporation of the Spring and Spring Cloud ecosystems make it an excellent choice for building service components; Ratpack's nature as a reactive web framework and its emphasis on performance and efficiency make it a premiere choice for a durable web tier. When the two frameworks join forces, developers become unstoppable. This talk will showcase Ratpack and Spring Boot's complementary integrations, and demonstrate, through live coding, building a high performance microservice.</p>

							      	<p class='white'>Your team is excited about getting started with Spring Boot and Cloud Native, but you're not entirely sure you're ready to have the team continuously delivering to prod using cf push from their local desktops. The freedom of cloud native development can be very empowering for developers, but it shouldn't be something that terrifies the operations and security teams. We'll discuss how you can setup a fast and reliable deployment process, as well as some interesting things to thing about in the future. One of the most well known descriptions of these new paradigms is the Twelve Factor App, which describes elements of cloud native applications. Many of these needs are squarely met through the Spring Framework, others require support from other systems. In this session we will examine each of the twelve factors and present how Spring, and platforms such as Cloud Foundry satisfy them, and in some cases we’ll even suggest that responsibility should shift from Spring to platforms. At the conclusion you will understand what is needed for cloud‐native applications, why and how to deliver on those requirements.</p>
